<h1 align="center">Machine Learning - Employee Turnover Rate</h1>

This project aims to explore the use of machine learning techniques to predict employee turnover rates in organizations. Employee turnover is a critical issue that affects the success and stability of any organization. Therefore, understanding the factors that contribute to employee turnover and predicting the likelihood of employee churn can help organizations take proactive measures to retain their employees and reduce the associated costs.

The project utilizes Python and several popular machine learning libraries, such as scikit-learn, matplotlib, pandas, and numpy, to preprocess and analyze the employee turnover data. The dataset contains various features such as employee salary, job satisfaction, and performance metrics, among others.

We apply several classification algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, to predict the employee turnover rates. We compare the performance of these algorithms using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, we perform feature selection and engineering to identify the critical factors that influence employee turnover rates.

The project provides insights into the factors that influence employee turnover and presents a predictive model that can assist organizations in taking proactive measures to reduce employee churn.
